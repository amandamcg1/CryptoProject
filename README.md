# CryptographyWebsite
## How I Spent My Time:
* Research: I allocated a significant portion of my time to thoroughly researching the concepts of
asymmetric cryptography. This research was crucial to ensure the accuracy and depth of the
content presented on the website.
* Design: I invested time in designing the website, focusing on creating a user-friendly and visually
appealing layout.
* Building the Simulation: A substantial part of my effort went into developing the RSA
cryptography simulation. This required attention to detail and coding expertise to ensure that
users could interact with the encryption and decryption processes effectively.
* Developing the Chatroom: Another significant portion of my time was dedicated to designing and
building the chatroom feature. This involved implementing secure messaging, encryption, and
user interaction.
* Deployment of the Site: I had only used vercel to deploy websites before as usually I’m focussed
on frontend so vercel works well. However, as I had the backend, I ended up using render. I
found a good video on YouTube that helped me figure out how to deploy the site.

## Challenges:
* Building the simulation: From the project timeline you can see I spent quite a bit of time on the
simulation. I was using a new package called "forge”, which required time to learn how to use
effectively.
* Developing the chatroom: Presented challenges as it required the use of the "socket.io" library to
create a connection between the backend and frontend.
* Site Design: The design of the website posed challenges, leading to changes in the layout to avoid
clutter and improve user experience. Once I realised how much information I wanted to include I
realised that the first design plan wouldn’t work as it was too cluttered.
Time Management:
* I initially had issues with time management, as I forgot about the project. However, once I
remembered, I made consistent progress for a few days to catch up to my project proposal.
* Once caught up, I made regular progress on the project, focusing on the simulation as it was the
central part of the project. The chatroom feature was added later in the development process.
Recovering from Setbacks:
To overcome the challenges I faced I made sure I dedicated enough time to the more difficult parts of
the development. I also googled my issues as much as I could. I also developed iteratively, to identify
and rectify issues promptly, rather than leaving them all at the end.

## What I Would Do Differently:
If given the opportunity to revisit this project, my focus would be on the following:
* Enhanced User Interface: I would work on improving the user interface of the chatroom,
ensuring that users can effectively engage with the chat and view their sent messages, rather
than just getting the received messages. I also would want to implement automatic scrolling as
right now the user has to scroll to see any further messages.
* Database Integration: I would consider implementing a proper database for more efficient data
management and storage. Currently all the data is held in an array in the backend. This is not a
very secure method.
* Better Authentication: To enhance security, I would adopt stronger authentication methods.
Currently I am just using localStorage.
